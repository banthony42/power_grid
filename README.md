# power_grid

The idea is to implement a grid with powered cell.
* A cell can be down, it's signal is equal to zero, or up, it's signal is greather than zero.
* A power up cell, spread it's signal to adjacent cell but loosing power with the distance.
* The cell light fade to black according to it's signal power.
<br>(The weaker the signal (close to zero) the darker the color)
